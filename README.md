# Sales Forecasting Project - Comprehensive Explanation

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop robust **sales forecasting models** using both **time series** and **causal modeling** techniques. This enables data-driven predictions about future sales based on historical patterns and trends.

## 📊 Data Understanding and Time Series Analysis

The initial steps involve thorough **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand temporal patterns, trends, seasonality, and any irregular components within the dataset.

### Key Tasks:
- Convert date columns to `datetime` format for time-indexing
- Handle missing data or anomalies if any
- Visualize sales trends across time
- Identify seasonality (weekly/monthly/yearly patterns)
- Check for stationarity (important for ARIMA-based models)

## 🧠 Models Used for Forecasting

The notebook systematically tests a variety of forecasting models, both **statistical** and **regression-based**:

---

### 1. 📆 Seasonal Naïve Model

#### Description:
A simple model that assumes the value at a given time point will be equal to the value at the same period in the previous season.

#### Use Case:
- Baseline model
- Useful in data with strong seasonality

#### Strengths:
- Simple and interpretable
- Low computational cost

---

### 2. 📈 Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)

#### Description:
A sophisticated exponential smoothing model that accounts for:
- Level
- Trend
- Seasonality

#### Parameters:
- Smoothing level (α)
- Smoothing trend (β)
- Smoothing seasonality (γ)

#### Use Case:
- When sales data exhibits a **trend** and **seasonal patterns**

---

### 3. 🔁 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA

#### ARIMA:
Captures autocorrelations in the data, useful for non-seasonal time series.

#### SARIMA:
Extends ARIMA by including seasonal terms, suitable for datasets with clear seasonal components.

#### Components:
- AR (AutoRegressive): dependency on previous observations
- I (Integrated): differencing to make the series stationary
- MA (Moving Average): dependency on past error terms

#### Use Case:
- Time series with seasonality and trend
- After differencing and checking for stationarity

---

### 4. 📊 Linear Regression Model

#### Description:
A regression-based model where **time and seasonality are used as independent variables** to predict sales.

#### Features Used:
- Time index
- Month/Week indicators
- Lagged features (possibly)

#### Use Case:
- When trends and seasonality can be captured as linear combinations

#### Benefits:
- Easy to interpret
- Allows for incorporating multiple features
- Performs well when trends are linear

## 🏁 Model Selection and Results

After evaluating all models, the **Linear Regression Model** outperformed the rest, including:

- Seasonal Naive
- Holt-Winters
- ARIMA/SARIMA

### Why did Linear Regression outperform?
- The data had a **strong linear trend** and **seasonality**, which the regression model captured effectively.
- Regression is less sensitive to short-term fluctuations compared to time-series-specific models.
- Better generalization in this context due to the regularity in historical patterns.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

- A total of **5 models** were tested.
- Despite being simpler, the **Linear Regression Model** provided the **most accurate forecasts**.
- This shows that **causal models** can sometimes outperform time-series models in structured and repetitive datasets.
- The assumption that **historical linear patterns will repeat** held true for this dataset.

---

## 📘 Guidelines for Future Use

- Always conduct EDA to understand data trends.
- Test multiple models — both statistical and regression-based.
- Validate results on test data before final selection.
- Understand business context — sales are often seasonal and influenced by events or campaigns.
